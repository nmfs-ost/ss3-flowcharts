# ss-flowcharts

Flowcharts for the [Stock Synthesis](https://vlab.ncep.noaa.gov/web/stock-synthesis) source code created using [drawio.Desktop](https://www.diagrams.net/)

## How can these files be used?

These flowcharts are designed to accompany the [Stock Synthesis source code](https://vlab.ncep.noaa.gov/web/stock-synthesis/document-library/-/document_library/0LmuycloZeIt/view/5556602) by providing a visual description of the code's logic. They may be useful for those who wish to understand the Stock Synthesis source code better. They are available as both .drawio files to bue used with drawio.Desktop and as .pdf files for easier web viewing.

## Where should I ask questions or report an issue about the flowcharts?

## Repository Organization
 
- Some flowcharts are in a single file, such as readStarter.drawio.
- Some are spread across multiple files that have section numbers assigned, such as readControl_4-5-2.drawio.
- The section numbers align to the SS_Label numbers in the associated tpl file.
- When there are multiple files, there is an index flow, such as readControl.drawio that directs to the proper sub files.
